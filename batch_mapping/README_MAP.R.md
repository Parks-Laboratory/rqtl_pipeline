## Usage: 

   ```R CMD BATCH --slave '--args rdata_file="<preprocessed inputs>.rdata" chtc_process_number="$1"' map.r```
   
## Inputs:

* rdata_file (see make_rdata.r for details):
	* Fields:
		* **traits**: List of traits. trait_index argument specifies which trait to map with
		* **mapping_jobs**: List of objects containing specifics of mapping to be done
			* Fields (per **mapping_job** object):
				* **cross**: R/QTL cross object containing genotype and phenotype information
				* **sex**: 'female', 'male', or 'hetero'
				* **log_status**: "logged" or "not-logged" specifies if log or raw trait 
								values should be used
				* **covariate_type**: 'additive', or 'interactive' (see below for difference)
				* **covariate_trait**: name of the trait to use in covariate mapping
		
## Outputs:

* The filenames indicate if males, females, or both males and females ('hetero') were used in the mapping.
* The filenames also indicate if the log or raw values were used ('logged' vs 'not_logged')
* When both males and females were mapped together, the filename indicates 
 if sex was used as an additive covariate ('the average phenotype is allowed 
 to be different in the two sexes, but the effect of the putative QTL is assumed 
 to be the same in the two sexes.'-Karl Broman) or as both an additive covariate and 
 an interactive covariate (allows QTL to be different in each sex)
* Finally, there are 4 types of files generated by each mapping: 
	* **.log** file has marker with highest LOD score for each chromosome
	* **.txt** file has LOD scores for all markers
	* **.pdf** file has the LOD plots with all markers and all chromosomes
			(.pdf used instead of .png b/c chtc nodes can't make .pngs out of the box)
	* **.rdata** file has the R/QTL scanone object, which can be loaded back
				into R to make additional plots
