### Including covariates
* For **additive covariate** "the average phenotype is allowed to be different
in the two sexes, but the effect of the putative QTL is assumed to
be the same in the two sexes." 
* For **interactive covariate**, 
"the QTL is allowed to be different in the two sexes."

("A brief tour of R/qtl"- Karl W Broman)


>Finally, we wish to emphasize that we strongly oppose the use of strict
thresholds for statistical significance; it is better to report genome-scanadjusted
p-values. P-values of 4.6% and 5.4% are essentially the same and
so should be treated the same. They shouldn’t be called “significant” and
“suggestive” according to whether they landed below or above a 5% cutoff.
Moreover, the importance accorded to a particular p-value depends upon a
number of factors, including the ultimate goals of the experiment.
